                    Abdulahi Hussein is a 25-year-old Bronx-based aspiring front-end developer, originally from Ghana, where he was born and completed school before moving to New York City in 2019. He began his college journey at BMCC, graduating in 2022, then going into Lehman College in 2022 and proudly graduating in 2024 with a degree in Computer Information Systems.<br></br>
                    Abdulahi enjoys working with VS Code to bring his creative ideas to life. Outside of tech, he takes pride in his Muslim identity, embraces street fashion and is a big soccer and video game enthusiast. He enjoys playing Call of Duty and rooting for his favorite soccer team Arsenal, with his favorite soccer player being Thomas Partey. He loves hanging out with friends, 
                    whether itâ€™s gaming, playing soccer, or even skiing in the winter.  And if he could have any superpower, it would be the ability to turn back time, to fix certain circumstances.<br></br>
                    Abdulahi is proof that greatness is measured by passion, ambition, and the drive to continue learning and growing daily.
